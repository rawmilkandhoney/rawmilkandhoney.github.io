Summarising who I am and how I got here is not a simple task when I have developed my approach to health through so many avenues. Having an online presence has allowed me to connect with people that have been able to help me improve my life dramatically with alternative practices. It's a privilege to have an outlet to share what I've learned with the hope of helping others to improve the lives of themselves and their families. 
</p>
<p>
I began my health journey trying to understand health through food. Throughout my whole childhood, I struggled with a range of health issues that allopathic medicine was never able to remedy. I ultimately gave in to the idea that my body was not capable of healing and that my genetics were flawed and I was unable to be a healthy person.
</p>
<p>
After hearing about people healing from changing their diet drastically, I thought, what have I got lose? After a year of experimentation and analysing what we are told about food, I came to believe the only way to ensure good health is to rely on the knowledge of our ancestors who proved to us over thousands of years that their ways actually work.
</p>
<p>
I was captivated by the work of Weston A. Price who documented the cultures and traditions of ancestral tribes. Their simultaneous perfect health and appetite for animal meats and fats was at first surprising, but less so when I realised the decline of human health and the coinciding demonisation of those same fats in Western society. 
</p>
<p>
After a year of eating nothing but a simple diet of animal foods with later incorporating nutrient-dense fruits and raw dairy, I had healed my gut to a point where I could consume the same foods that once caused me crippling pain and distress without any issues. 
</p>
<p>
The events of 2020 and the countless inconsistencies in the mainstream narrative made me question the consensus around contagion too. After uncovering the truths about food, I knew I wouldn't be surprised to find that most of what we think we know about illness is wrong. I came across doctors like Tom Cowan and Andrew Kaufman who although spent most of their careers as mainstream health professionals, were able to critique the virus model and contagion as a whole.

Like I said at the beginning of this story, it's not easy to say exactly what this page is meant to be. But what I do know is that I want it to be a source of information and encouragement for people who have been told they are broken, or can't heal or that someone with a white coat knows best. This is categorically false, and I look forward to helping more people discover it for themselves.
